# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model
 This Repository contains Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
 
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in females.The early diagnosis of Breast Cancer can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments.

## Attribute Information
ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3–32)
3.Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
4.radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
5.texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
6.perimeter
7.area
8.smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
9.compactness (perimeter² / area — 1.0)
10.concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
11.concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
12.symmetry
13.fractal dimension (“coastline approximation” — 1)

## Objective
This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection.The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.

## Business Case
The machine learning will reduce the time to process the images and predict whether it is benign or malignant.The business solution is to improve the effectiveness of radiologists by making the detection part smooth so that they can focus on providing accurate and faster results.The model prediction will help doctors to determine whether the patient needs immediate surgery or need chemotherapy.This will increase customers’ trust and increase revenue for medical labs and hospitals, directly and indirectly through customers satisfaction.

## Conclusion
The classification model built on XGBoost Algorithm gives the best results with 98% Accuracy.
